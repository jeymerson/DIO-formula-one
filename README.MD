# Fastify Minimal API

This project demonstrates the creation of a minimal API using Fastify, addressing the concepts of CORS and Boilerplate. The API provides information about Formula 1 teams and drivers.

## Technologies Used

- Fastify
- @fastify/cors

## Concepts Covered

### Minimal API

A minimal API is a simple and straightforward implementation that allows understanding and practicing the basic concepts of an API. This project creates endpoints to list Formula 1 teams and drivers and to retrieve detailed information about a specific driver.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS is a security policy that allows controlling which origins can access the API's resources. In this project, CORS was configured to allow access from any origin.

### Boilerplate

Boilerplate refers to a basic and reusable structure to quickly start new projects. This project provides an example of a boilerplate for a minimal API with Fastify, which can be easily expanded and modified for different use cases.
